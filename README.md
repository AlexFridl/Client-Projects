# Client Projects

This repository collects projects created for clients.  
They vary in scope â€” some are adapted from earlier academic work, while others were developed as independent freelance projects.  

At the moment, the repository includes a project originally based on my thesis work, customized for a client.  
Although the core functionality has been implemented, the project has not yet been deployed due to additional client requirements that are still pending.  

More projects will be added over time as I continue to expand my portfolio of client-focused work.
